## Google analytics dashboard

Created for the NICE Stakeholders team spike week.
Borrowed heavily from [https://github.com/KaterinaLupacheva/react-google-analytics-dashboard](https://github.com/KaterinaLupacheva/react-google-analytics-dashboard)
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Set up

You will need viewIDs for your services which are currently kept in environment variables. Do not do this for public deployment as your viewIDs will be visible.

Edit the [dashboardConfig.js](https://github.com/emollett/dashboard/blob/master/src/dashboardConfig.js) file to change which services are on the dashboard.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
